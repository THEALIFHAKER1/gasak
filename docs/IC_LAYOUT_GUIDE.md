# IC Layout Design for User Dialogs

## Overview

The user management dialogs have been redesigned with a modern "IC" (Information Card) layout that provides a more visually appealing and organized user experience.

## Design Features

### 1. Edit User Dialog

- **Gradient Header**: Features a dynamic header with gradient background showing user avatar and role
- **Three-Column Layout**:
  - Left: Profile picture card with upload/delete functionality
  - Right: Two cards for Basic Information and Security Settings
- **Card-Based Sections**: Each section is contained in a visually distinct card
- **Role-Based Icons**: Different icons for admin (crown), leader (shield), and member (users)
- **Improved Spacing**: Better visual hierarchy and breathing room

### 2. Create User Dialog

- **Green Gradient Theme**: Uses emerald gradient to distinguish from edit dialog
- **UserPlus Icon**: Clear visual indication for creation action
- **Enhanced Role Selection**: Detailed role descriptions with icons
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Integrated image upload during user creation
- **Security Section**: Dedicated card for password setup

## Key Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy

- Clear section headers with icons
- Consistent card spacing and padding
- Gradient headers for better visual appeal
- Role badges with appropriate colors

### User Experience

- Larger dialog size (800px) for better content organization

### Accessibility

- Proper color contrast for all elements
- Logical tab order through form fields

## Color Scheme

### Edit Dialog

- **Camera**: Profile picture management
- **Lock**: Security settings
- **Crown**: Admin role
- **Shield**: Leader role
- **Users**: Member role
- **UserPlus**: Create user action
